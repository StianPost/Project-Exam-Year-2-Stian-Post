## Info

This project is my final project exam while studying front-end at noroff, it will be built using Next.JS using Typescript.
The styling will be made using TailwindCSS and some custom SCSS styling and maybe some styled components.

This site is a cabin booking site where you'll be able to book cabins from all over Norway, the design is made using figma.

### More info

There must be a home, search results, details, contact and admin page.
You'll be able to log in as an Admin and add new cabins, look at messages both from the enquiries and from the contact page. I will also see if I can add a booking system so that you can see available rooms and if they've been booked.
