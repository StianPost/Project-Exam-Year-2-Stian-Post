This project was my project exam for my 2nd year on Noroff, it's a cabin booking website where you can search/filter through cabins and book them.

## Description

I was given the task of designing and creating a booking site using a JS framework, that being Next JS or React.

The site must have:
- Homepage
- Results page
- Details [id] page
- Contact page
- Admin page

On the admin page you must be able to create and delete cabins, one should also be able to read enquiries and messages that get sent to the site
